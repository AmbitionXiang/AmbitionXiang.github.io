I am now an R&D expert in China Telecom eSurfing Cloud (State Cloud). Previously, I obtained a Ph.D. degree from [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2025. I was very fortunate to have [Prof. Mingyu Gao](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/) as my advisor. Before joining Tsinghua, I obtained a bachelor's degree from [School of Information Science and Engineering](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm) in 2020. 
My research interests mainly lie in confidential computing and system security, especially, the trusted execution environment (TEE), including its applications, constructions, side channels, formal models, and combination with cryptography. Here is my [CV](https://AmbitionXiang.github.io/files/cv_en_2508.pdf)/[简历](https://AmbitionXiang.github.io/files/cv_cn_2508.pdf).
