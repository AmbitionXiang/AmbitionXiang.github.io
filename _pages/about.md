I am now a Ph.D candidate in Institute for [Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am very fortunate to have [Prof. Mingyu Gao](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/) as my advisor. Before joining Tsinghua, I obtained a bachelor's degree from [School of Information Science and Engineering](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm) in 2020. I studied at [School of Transportation](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/jt_en/main.psp), Southeast University from Aug 2016 to September 2017 as I was a freshman. My research interests mainly lie in confidential computing and system security, especially, the trusted execution environment (TEE), including its applications, constructions, side channels, formal models, and combination with cryptography. Here is my [CV](https://AmbitionXiang.github.io/files/cv_2406.pdf).
